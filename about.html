<h1><u><p>MelonicOverlord - My Portfolio:</p></u></h1>
&nbsp;
<p>Soulnode: A Minecraft Server Hosting Service (and other hosting options). I  worked here for around ~8 Months, the time whilst it was running. We eventually ended up merging with a different company, ReviveNode, due to certain circumstances. The company was run by YouTuber SoulStriker. The ReviveNode site can be found here: https://revivenode.com/</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Dragonsword: A Minecraft Server which still runs to this day - I am manager here as of currently, so I manage a lot of the staff, roles, ingame stuff and other things. I also helped to set up our backend panel and some other server end related things. The Discord server for here is: https://discord.gg/UZMVQZgheR</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Win11 React: A Website built in ReactJS, to "simulate" what Microsoft's Windows 11 Operating System is like. The project is in no way affiliated with Microsoft though, and should not be confused as being so. The website can be found here: https://win11.blueedge.me/. The Discord server can also be found at: https://discord.gg/VHyWh9u9NJ. This project also has several other smaller projects linked to it, such as Android in React and Asylum OS, however these are still in a somewhat development state. </p>
&nbsp;
<p>Pedestria: Pedestria is a Minecraft server which I worked at for a relatively long-ish amount of time. I held a variety of different roles, however they were mostly higher up ones other than when I first started. Towards the end, I was doing a lot of the work for the server. Nowadays, the server still somewhat runs however is extremely dead, and the current developers are not doing much work (as far as I'm aware). The server shut down for around 6months to be "remastered" however had to be put back up in its old state due to Dragonsword.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Logtime: A Server Network which I ran for a Discord friend using my SoulNode earnings & some resources I was still allowed to use by Pedestria after leaving. We had to shut after SoulNode stopped, as I had no way of hosting properly anymore. </p>
&nbsp;
<p>Melon's World: A Server Network for myself which I attempted to run, however development never finished as I did not have the time or motivation to do so. Instead, I shut this and turned it into Logtime.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>CubTime: Previously known as CraftMC and IDMC, I worked here as Discord Staff towards the end of its life. I was also a relatively active member during its prime and decline.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>3am Milk: A Discord server where I worked as Discord Staff. I later ended up resigning from here, however during my time I did a lot of work and even tried to run a Discord bot however it did not work out as planned.</p>
